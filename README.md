#Claptrap

A functional php web framework

##Objectives
- provide framework for building web apps in a lisp-like functional style
- provide a clojuresque repl experience, including reloading function/class definitions on the fly (runkit? depends on php7 support)
- other completely ridiculous objectives


Request comes in, becomes transit object, returned as response once all functions run series of actions to transform

routes register themselves- lookup as filename?

wire functions to routes via config file
