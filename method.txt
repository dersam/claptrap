create request object

defroute() - takes arbitrary set of functions, each receiving a state transit object
    - each function transforms the transitobj
    - each function must return the transformed transitobj
    - route must define output type - at the end of the transformations, the
        state object is passed through to the response builder
        - possible outputs: json, txt, template (twig? etc)
        - responsedata on the transit object is used by the response builder
